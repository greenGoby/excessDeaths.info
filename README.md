# Excess Deaths

## One time preparation

You need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) installed.  You can install Angular CLI by using `npm install -g @angular/cli`  

Before building or running for the first time, you need to do an `npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
